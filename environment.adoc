## Environment Overview

You will be interacting with an OpenShift environment that is running on {{ ENVIRONMENT }}. The environment consists of the following systems:

* {{ MASTERS }} master nodes
* {{ INFRA }} infrastructure nodes
* {{ NODES }} "application" nodes
{% if NFS_ENABLED %}
* An NFS server
{% endif %}

The infrastructure node is providing several services:

{% if LOGGING_ENABLED %}
* Aggregated logging
{% endif %}
{% if METRICS_ENABLED %}
* Cluster metrics
{% endif %}
* Gogs
* This lab manual
* The OpenShift Docker registry
* The OpenShift router

Additionally, {{ NUM_USERS }} user accounts have been provisioned.

You will see various code and command blocks throughout these exercises. Some of
the command blocks can be copy/pasted directly. Others will require
modification of the command before execution. If you see a command block with a
red border (see below), the command will require modification. Typically this is
a substitution of your username or user number:

[source,role=copypaste]
----
some command for userXX
